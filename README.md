## 🛡️ Security Testing Capabilities

### **Multi-Agent Security Framework**

Our advanced testing framework employs specialized security agents:

- **🔍 ReconAgent** - System discovery and reconnaissance
- **🔐 AuthAgent** - Authentication and session security
- **✅ InputValidationAgent** - Injection attack testing
- **🤖 PromptSecurityAgent** - AI-specific security testing
- **🔑 AuthorizationAgent** - Access control validation
- **🛡️ DetectionDefenseAgent** - Security controls assessment

### **Vulnerability Coverage**

- ✅ **SQL Injection** - Database security testing
- ✅ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Client-side attack vectors
- ✅ **Command Injection** - System command execution
- ✅ **Prompt Injection** - AI manipulation attacks
- ✅ **Authentication Bypass** - Access control testing
- ✅ **Session Management** - Session security validation
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Data sanitization testing
- ✅ **Authorization Bypass** - Privilege escalation testing

### **AI-Specific Security Testing**

- **Prompt Injection Detection** - Direct and indirect manipulation
- **Context Poisoning** - Conversation context attacks
- **AI Safety Boundaries** - System prompt extraction attempts
- **Model Manipulation** - Behavior modification testing
- **Tool Access Control** - MCP tool permission validation

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **Development Teams**
- Pre-deployment security validation
- Continuous security testing in CI/CD

- Context isolation verification

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Basic Configuration**

Edit `security_modules/config.py` to configure:

```python
# API Configuration
API_CONFIG = {
    "timeout": 30,
    "max_retries": 3,
    "rate_limit": 60
}

# Security Testing Parameters
SECURITY_CONFIG = {
    "enable_destructive_tests": False,
    "test_depth": "comprehensive",
    "parallel_agents": True
}
```

### **Custom Testing Targets**

Configure target systems in the web interface or programmatically:

```python
target_config = {
    "base_url": "https://your-ai-system.com",
    "endpoints": ["/chat", "/api/message"],
    "authentication": "bearer_token"
}
```

## 📊 Reporting

The framework generates comprehensive reports in multiple formats:

- **📄 PDF Reports** - Executive and technical documentation
