# ai_tester_core

Core modules for the AI Chatbot Security Tester.

This package now includes skeleton implementations for:

- `security.detectors` – placeholders for vulnerability detection modules
  such as prompt injection, jailbreak analysis, data leakage scanning,
  output validation, model theft detection and training data poisoning
  analysis.
- `attack_generation` – helper functions for generating adversarial prompts
  via fuzzing, creative generation, multi‑turn sequences, encoding bypasses
  and social‑engineering techniques.

These modules provide a starting point for building the full modular
security framework described in the project roadmap.
